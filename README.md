Bug with inheritance in new Firebase sdk
---

I created this to demonstrate that traditional polymorphism is not supported in the new [Firebase SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup).

In my opinion, supporting object inheritance is critical. Upgrading from the older firebase to the new setup has really been a struggle because of this regression. 

**Note:** 
_To run this sample you will need to add a valid `google_services.json`_
